int sum = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++)
{
    sum += i;
}
Console.WriteLine("Sum of first " + N + " natural numbers: " + sum);


-->Explanation:

Initialization: int sum = 0; initializes a variable sum to zero. This variable will store the sum of the natural numbers.

For Loop: for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) is a loop that iterates from 1 to N (inclusive). i is the loop variable.

Summation: sum += i; adds the current value of i to the sum in each iteration, effectively calculating the sum of the first N natural numbers.

Output: Console.WriteLine("Sum of first " + N + " natural numbers: " + sum); prints the result to the console.

-->Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: The time complexity of this code is O(N), where N is the input size. The loop iterates N times, and the time taken grows linearly with the size of N.

Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) because the space required for the sum variable is constant, regardless of the input size.

-->Summary:
The code calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers using a simple loop. Its time complexity is linear, making it an efficient algorithm for this particular task. As N grows, the time taken to calculate the sum increases proportionally.
